# Capstone Project - Group 6 | Blossom Academy

## Project Title
**Unearthing the Giants: A Data-Driven Emissions Exposé**

## Project Overview
This capstone project is the culmination of our Data Analytics training at Blossom Academy. The project explores over a century (1854–2022) of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data from top global emitters. Our mission was to uncover insights that could support urgent climate action and policy development aligned with SDG 13 – Climate Action.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning prediction)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Git & GitHub**

## Project Structure
- `Group_6_Python_Project.ipynb`: The main notebook containing data cleaning, EDA, visualization, and machine learning.
- `Group 6 Python Presentation.pptx`: A summary presentation of the findings.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (you’re reading it!).
- `data/`: Folder to store raw and cleaned data.
- `images/`: Folder for plots and visualizations.

## Key Objectives
- Identify the top contributors to global GHG emissions over time.
- Explore the role of company types and commodities in emissions.
- Examine geographical emission patterns.
- Investigate the link between emissions and production value.
- Forecast future emissions using machine learning.
- Recommend action points for emissions reduction and climate accountability.

## Summary of Findings

- **Emission Trends Over Time**: A clear upward trend in global emissions was observed, with sharp increases from the mid-20th century driven by industrial growth and fossil fuel dependency.
  
- **Top Emitters Identified**: The analysis revealed the top 10 emitting entities, dominated by investor-owned and state-owned fossil fuel companies.
  
- **Geographical Distribution**: Emissions are concentrated in specific regions, with a few countries and continents being disproportionately responsible.
  
- **Product vs. Fugitive Emissions**: A comparison of emission types showed significant contributions from both product-related emissions and fugitive methane leaks, especially from oil and gas.
  
- **Emissions vs. Production Value**: A scatter plot on a log scale indicated a positive but weak correlation between production value and emissions, suggesting financial incentives may drive emission intensity.
  
- **2030 Emissions Forecast**: A predictive model forecasted continued growth in emissions by 2030 if no action is taken, reinforcing the urgency of climate mitigation policies.
